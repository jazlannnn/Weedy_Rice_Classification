# Weedy Rice Classification for Mobile Application using Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

Rice is crucial for Malaysia's food security and economy, but weedy rice competes aggressively with cultivated varieties, causing substantial annual losses. Traditional methods like manual weeding and chemicals often fall short due to weedy rice's resilience and adaptability, creating a pressing need for innovative solutions to accurately differentiate between weedy rice and cultivated rice, addressing current limitations and leveraging advanced technology.

Technologies Used : YOLOv5, Pytorch, ONNX, Tensorflow, TFLite, Flutter, Firebase
